# calibratoR
calibratoR implements several methods for statistical calibration of climate forecasts (typically on a monthly/seasonal basis),  which range from simple mean/variance adjustment to more sophisticated Ensemble Model Output Statistics (EMOS) options which take into account the existing correspondence between the ensemble mean and the observations in the calibration process.
